Hardware Interface Module

This module defines an abstract base class for interacting with hardware components
such as card readers and NFC devices. It provides a consistent interface for
hardware operations, allowing the backend to interact with different hardware
implementations without requiring modifications to the core logic.

Classes:
    HardwareInterface: Abstract base class for hardware interactions.
