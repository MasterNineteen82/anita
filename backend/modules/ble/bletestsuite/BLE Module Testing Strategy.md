# BLE Module Testing Strategy

## Current Coverage
- Models: 100% 
- Manager: 28%
- Overall: 15%

## Testing Approach
1. Unit tests for models and utilities
2. Integration tests for manager functionality
3. Mock hardware dependencies

## Challenging Areas
- Hardware-dependent functionality
- Asynchronous operations
- Race conditions in connections

## Testing Goals
- [ ] Reach 50% coverage by EOQ
- [ ] Add routes testing
- [ ] Test error recovery scenarios
