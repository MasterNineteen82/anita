# ANITA API Test Run Analysis and Troubleshooting

## General Observations

* **Inconsistent Results:** Some tests pass, while others fail with 500 errors or "Not Implemented" (501) responses. This indicates that the API is not fully implemented or has some issues with error handling.
* **NFC Issues:** Several NFC-related tests are failing, suggesting problems with the NFC module or hardware connectivity.
* **System Information Issues:** Tests related to system information (log level, health, system info) are also failing, indicating potential problems with the system monitoring components.
* **Smartcard Issues:** Tests related to smartcard operations are failing, suggesting problems with the smartcard module or hardware connectivity.
* **BLE Issues:** BLE tests are mostly passing, but there are some failures related to data validation.
* **HTML Content Tests:** Tests for HTML content are failing because the response body is empty or not a valid HTML format. This is likely due to the splash page issue.

## Detailed Troubleshooting

### 1. NFC Issues

* **"Get NFC reader status" (Fail):**
  * **Error:** "Device name is a non-empty string"
  * **Possible Cause:** The NFC reader is not properly initialized or is not returning a device name.
  * **Troubleshooting Steps:**
    * Check if the NFC reader is connected and properly configured.
    * Verify that the `NFCManager` is correctly initialized and can access the reader.
    * Add logging to the `get_nfc_status` function in `nfc_routes.py` to check the reader status and device name.
    * Check the logs for any errors related to NFC initialization.
* **"Read content from NFC tag" (Fail):**
  * **Error:** 500 Internal Server Error
  * **Possible Cause:** The NFC reader is not detecting a tag, or there is an error during the read operation.
  * **Troubleshooting Steps:**
    * Ensure that an NFC tag is present and within range of the reader.
    * Check the `api_nfc_read` function in `nfc_routes.py` for error handling and logging.
    * Verify that the `NFCManager` is correctly handling read operations.
* **"Write text to NFC tag" (Fail):**
  * **Error:** 500 Internal Server Error
  * **Possible Cause:** The NFC reader is not able to write to the tag, or there is an error during the write operation.
  * **Troubleshooting Steps:**
    * Ensure that the NFC tag is writable and not locked.
    * Check the `api_nfc_write_text` function in `nfc_routes.py` for error handling and logging.
    * Verify that the `NFCManager` is correctly handling write operations.
* **"Write URI to NFC tag", "Write vCard to NFC tag", "Emulate an NFC tag" (Fail):**
  * **Error:** 501 Not Implemented
  * **Possible Cause:** These features are not yet implemented in the API.
  * **Troubleshooting Steps:**
    * Implement the corresponding functions in `nfc_routes.py`.
    * Update the API documentation to reflect the implemented features.
* **"Write raw NDEF records to NFC tag" (Fail):**
  * **Error:** 422 Unprocessable Entity
  * **Possible Cause:** The request body is not valid, or the data is not in the correct format.
  * **Troubleshooting Steps:**
    * Check the `NFCWriteRawRequest` model in `nfc_routes.py` for the expected data format.
    * Verify that the request body is valid and conforms to the model.
    * Add validation to the `api_nfc_write_raw` function to check the data format.

#### 2. System Information Issues

* **"Get current log level" (Fail):**
  * **Error:** 500 Internal Server Error
  * **Possible Cause:** There is an error retrieving the current log level.
  * **Troubleshooting Steps:**
    * Check the `get_log_level` function in `system_routes.py` for error handling and logging.
    * Verify that the `config.LOG_LEVEL_NAME` and `config.LOG_LEVEL` attributes are correctly defined in `config.py`.
* **"Set log level" (Fail):**
  * **Error:** "Status is one of the valid log levels"
  * **Possible Cause:** The log level is not being validated correctly.
  * **Troubleshooting Steps:**
    * Check the `set_log_level` function in `system_routes.py` for validation logic.
    * Ensure that the log level is being set correctly and that the API is returning a valid response.
* **"Get system information" (Fail):**
  * **Error:** "Start time and uptime are in valid format", "Memory used and disk used are non-negative numbers"
  * **Possible Cause:** The system information is not being formatted correctly, or the values are not valid.
  * **Troubleshooting Steps:**
    * Check the `get_system_info` function in `system_routes.py` for formatting and validation logic.
    * Verify that the system information is being retrieved correctly and that the values are valid.
* **"Get system health status" (Fail):**
  * **Error:** "Components object should have specific structure"
  * **Possible Cause:** The health status is not being formatted correctly.
  * **Troubleshooting Steps:**
    * Check the `get_health_status` function in `system_routes.py` for formatting logic.
    * Verify that the health status is being retrieved correctly and that the components object has the expected structure.

#### 3. Smartcard Issues

* **"Get available smartcard readers" (Fail):**
  * **Error:** 500 Internal Server Error
  * **Possible Cause:** There is an error retrieving the list of smartcard readers.
  * **Troubleshooting Steps:**
    * Check the `get_readers` function in `smartcard_routes.py` for error handling and logging.
    * Verify that the `SmartcardManager` is correctly initialized and can access the readers.
* **"Get smartcard status" (Fail):**
  * **Error:** 500 Internal Server Error
  * **Possible Cause:** There is an error retrieving the smartcard status.
  * **Troubleshooting Steps:**
    * Check the `get_card_status` function in `smartcard_routes.py` for error handling and logging.
    * Verify that the `SmartcardManager` is correctly handling status retrieval.
* **"Get ATR from smartcard" (Fail):**
  * **Error:** 400 Bad Request
  * **Possible Cause:** The request is not valid, or the reader is not specified correctly.
  * **Troubleshooting Steps:**
    * Check the `api_smartcard_atr` function in `routes.py` for request validation.
    * Verify that the reader parameter is being passed correctly.
* **"Transmit APDU command" (Fail):**
  * **Error:** 500 Internal Server Error
  * **Possible Cause:** There is an error transmitting the APDU command.
  * **Troubleshooting Steps:**
    * Check the `api_smartcard_transmit` function in `routes.py` for error handling and logging.
    * Verify that the `SmartcardManager` is correctly handling APDU transmission.

#### 4. BLE Issues

* **"Read characteristic" (Fail):**
  * **Error:** "Value in the data object is either null or of a specific data type"
  * **Possible Cause:** The data type of the characteristic value is not being validated correctly.
  * **Troubleshooting Steps:**
    * Check the `read_characteristic` function in `ble_routes.py` for data type validation.
    * Verify that the data type is being handled correctly.

#### 5. HTML Content Tests

* **"Smartcard", "Mifare", "Nfc", "Dashboard" (Fail):**
  * **Error:** "Response body is empty", "Response body is not a valid HTML format"
  * **Possible Cause:** The HTML content is not being served correctly, or there is an error rendering the templates.
  * **Troubleshooting Steps:**
    * Check the corresponding functions in `pages.py` for error handling and logging.
    * Verify that the templates are being rendered correctly and that the HTML content is valid.
    * Check the static file serving configuration in `app.py`.

### General Recommendations

* **Implement Error Handling:** Add comprehensive error handling and logging to all API endpoints.
* **Validate Data:** Validate all request parameters and response data to ensure that they are in the correct format.
* **Check Hardware Connectivity:** Verify that all hardware devices (NFC reader, smartcard reader, BLE devices, RFID reader) are connected and properly configured.
* **Update Dependencies:** Ensure that all dependencies are up-to-date and compatible with the application.
* **Test Thoroughly:** Test all API endpoints with different inputs and scenarios to ensure that they are working correctly.
* **Implement Missing Features:** Implement the features that are currently returning "Not Implemented" (501) errors.
* **Review Code:** Review the code for any potential issues or bugs.
* **Use a Debugger:** Use a debugger to step through the code and identify the root cause of the errors.

By following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the issues in your API and ensure that it is working correctly.
