    "# WebSocket Integration Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    " This document details the WebSocket approach within ANITA, providing a comprehensive guide to its implementation and usage. WebSockets enable real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and servers over a single TCP connection. This is particularly useful for applications requiring low-latency data transfer and instant updates, such as device monitoring and real-time event streams.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why WebSockets?\n",
    "\n",
    " Traditional HTTP communication follows a request-response model, which can be inefficient for real-time applications that require the client to continuously poll the server for updates. WebSockets provide a persistent connection, allowing the server to push updates to the client as soon as they are available, reducing latency and improving responsiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Details\n",
    "\n",
    "### WebSocket Server\n",
    "\n",
    " The WebSocket server is implemented using FastAPI and the `websockets` library in Python. It handles the initial handshake, manages active connections using the `WebSocketManager` class, and routes messages to appropriate handlers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Connection Management:** The `WebSocketManager` class handles the establishment and termination of WebSocket connections, storing active clients and managing rooms.\n",
    "* **Message Routing:** The `WebSocketManager` routes incoming messages to registered handlers based on the message `type` field.\n",
    "* **Authentication/Authorization:** Implemented within the `WebSocketManager`, ensuring only authenticated clients can access specific resources. Utilizes token-based authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "### WebSocket Client\n",
    "\n",
    " The WebSocket client is implemented in JavaScript within the frontend, using the standard `WebSocket` API. It establishes a connection with the WebSocket server and handles sending and receiving messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Websocket Client - Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Connection Manager:** Establishes and maintains the WebSocket connection using the `WebSocket` object. Handles reconnection logic.\n",
    "* **Message Encoder/Decoder:** Encodes outgoing messages into JSON format and parses incoming JSON messages.\n",
    "* **Event Handlers:** Handles WebSocket events such as `open`, `close`, `message`, and `error`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Communication Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    " The WebSocket communication follows a JSON-based protocol to ensure proper message handling and data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Message Format\n",
    "\n",
    " Messages are formatted as JSON objects, with a `type` field indicating the message type and a `payload` field containing the message data.\n",
    "\n",
    " ```json\n",
    " {\n",
    "    \"type\": \"message_type\",\n",
    "    \"payload\": {\n",
    "    \"key1\": \"value1\",\n",
    "    \"key2\": \"value2\"\n",
    "    }\n",
    " }\n",
    " ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Message Types\n",
    "\n",
    " Common message types include (but are not limited to):\n",
    "\n",
    "* `system.heartbeat`: Periodic heartbeat from the server.\n",
    "* `uwb.device_list`: List of available UWB devices.\n",
    "* `uwb.location`: Location update for a UWB device.\n",
    "* `error`: Indicates an error condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Security Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    " WebSocket security is crucial to protect against unauthorized access and data breaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Authentication\n",
    "\n",
    " Clients must authenticate themselves before accessing protected WebSocket endpoints. This is achieved through token-based authentication, where the client sends a JWT token in the initial connection or via a specific authentication message.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Authorization\n",
    "\n",
    " The server verifies the client's JWT token and checks for appropriate roles or permissions before allowing access to specific resources or actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encryption\n",
    "\n",
    " All WebSocket communication is encrypted using WSS (WebSocket Secure), which utilizes TLS (Transport Layer Security) to protect against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. Ensure your server is configured to use HTTPS.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Error Handling\n",
    "\n",
    " Robust error handling is essential to ensure the stability and reliability of the WebSocket connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Client-side Error Handling\n",
    "\n",
    " The client handles WebSocket errors such as connection errors, message parsing errors, and authentication errors. Error messages are displayed in the message log.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Server-side Error Handling\n",
    "\n",
    " The server handles WebSocket errors such as invalid message formats, unauthorized access attempts, and internal server errors. Error messages are sent back to the client via the `error` message type.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Keep messages small:** Smaller messages reduce latency and improve performance.\n",
    "* **Use JSON format:** Standardized JSON format for easy parsing and handling.\n",
    "* **Implement heartbeats:** The server sends periodic heartbeat messages to detect broken connections.\n",
    "* **Handle reconnections:** The client implements automatic reconnection logic to handle temporary network outages.\n",
    "* **Validate messages:** Both client and server should validate message structure and content.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Usage\n",
    "\n",
    " ```javascript\n",
    " // Example WebSocket client code\n",
    " const socket = new WebSocket('wss://example.com/ws/uwb');"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "id": "061eaea0",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    " socket.addEventListener('open', (event) => {\n",
    "    console.log('WebSocket connection opened');\n",
    "    socket.send(JSON.stringify({ type: 'get_active_devices', payload: {} }));\n",
    " });"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "id": "583c37e6",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    " socket.addEventListener('message', (event) => {\n",
    "    const message = JSON.parse(event.data);\n",
    "    console.log('Received message:', message);\n",
    "    // Handle different message types\n",
    "    if (message.type === 'uwb.device_list') {\n",
    "    console.log('UWB Devices:', message.payload.devices);\n",
    "    }\n",
    " });"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "id": "452e2f10",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    " socket.addEventListener('close', (event) => {\n",
    "    console.log('WebSocket connection closed');\n",
    " });"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "id": "92f6cb01",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    " socket.addEventListener('error', (event) => {\n",
    "    console.error('WebSocket error:', event);\n",
    " });\n",
    " ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    " WebSockets provide a powerful and efficient way to implement real-time communication in ANITA. By following the guidelines and best practices outlined in this document, we can ensure a robust, secure, and scalable WebSocket implementation. The `WebSocketManager`, standardized message formats, and robust error handling contribute to a reliable and maintainable system."
